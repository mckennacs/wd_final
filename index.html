                    "Berserk (Japanese: ベルセルク, Hepburn: Beruseruku) is a
                    Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Kentaro
                    Miura. Set in a medieval Europe-inspired dark fantasy world,
                    the story centers on the characters of Guts, a lone
                    mercenary, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band
                    called the 'Band of the Hawk.'"

                    "As of May 2021, the Berserk manga had over 50 million
                    copies in circulation, including digital versions, making it
                    one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It
                    received the Award for Excellence at the 6th installment of
                    the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2002. Berserk has been
                    widely acclaimed, particularly for its dark setting,
                    storytelling, characters, and Miura's detailed artwork."
