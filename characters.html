                        <p>
                            Guts, renowned as the "Black Swordsman", is a former
                            mercenary and branded wanderer who travels the world
                            in a constant internal struggle between pursuing his
                            own ends and upholding his attachments to those dear
                            to him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At one time driven solely by his will to survive,
                            Guts finds purpose in life upon joining the Band of
                            the Falcon, greatly helping in the faction's storied
                            successes during the Hundred-Year War as captain of
                            the band's raiders. He eventually becomes
                            dissatisfied with clinging to Griffith's dream and
                            departs from the band in pursuit of his own.

                                His name has often times been translated by some

                                "Gutts," or "Gattsu." However, the official

                                Kentaro Miura himself, is in fact, "Guts."

                        <p>
                            Griffith, is the charismatic leader and founder of
                            the Band of The Hawk. Named after his helmet which
                            was forged in the shape of a Hawk's head.

                            Extraordinarily charismatic, intelligent, and
                            handsome, his skill with his sabre and tactics gives
                            him and his band the reputation of invincibility,
                            making him the favored choice of the Midland King,
                            who was locked in a century long war with the Empire
                            of Chuder.

                        <p>
                            Casca was the only female member in the original
                            Band of the Hawk and is behind only Griffith and
                            Guts in swordsmanship. Her ambivalent relationship
                            to both of them makes her moody and capricious.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Casca joins the Hawks after Griffith empowers her to
                            save herself from an assault by a nobleman who
                            bought her from her parents, and since that time
                            harbors feelings towards Griffith which most of
                            their comrades are aware of.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While Casca was against Guts joining the Hawks, her
                            hostility towards him gradually waned as she came to
                            accept him as a comrade for saving her life multiple
                            times while developing feelings for him.
                        </p>
