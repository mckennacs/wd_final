                    (三浦 建太郎, Miura Kentarō, July 11, 1966 - May 6, 2021)
                    was a Japanese manga artist. He was best known for his
                    acclaimed dark fantasy series Berserk, which began
                    serialization in 1989 and continued until his death.

                    As of 2021, Berserk had more than 50 million copies in
                    circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series
                    of all time.

                    In 2002, Miura received the Award for Excellence at the 6th
                    Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prizes.

                    Born on July 11, 1966 to artist parents, Miura began drawing
                    at age 10. While still a teenager, he won a New Artist Award
                    from the leading manga magazine Weekly Shonen. He attended
                    the art college of Nihon University in Tokyo and saw the
                    first installment of Berserk appear in print shortly after
                    he graduated in 1989. He would draw thousands of pages of
                    the series over the course of his career.
